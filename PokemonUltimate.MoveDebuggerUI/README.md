# PokemonUltimate.MoveDebuggerUI

Windows Forms application for testing moves multiple times and viewing comprehensive statistics in a visual interface.

## Purpose

This is a **visual version** of the `MoveDebugger` console application. It provides:

- **Easy configuration** - Select move, attacker, target, level, and number of tests from dropdowns
- **Visual statistics** - View results in tables and formatted text
- **Progress tracking** - See progress bar during test execution
- **Multiple result views** - Summary, Damage, Status Effects, and Actions tabs

## Features

### Configuration Panel (Left Side)

- **Move to Test** - Dropdown to select move
- **Attacker Pokemon** - Dropdown to select Pokemon using the move
- **Target Pokemon** - Dropdown to select Pokemon to test against
- **Level** - Numeric input for Pokemon level (1-100)
- **Number of Tests** - Numeric input for how many tests to run (1-10000)
- **Detailed Output** - Checkbox (currently not used in UI, kept for future)
- **Run Tests** - Button to start execution
- **Progress Bar** - Shows execution progress
- **Status Label** - Shows current status

### Results Panel (Right Side)

Four tabs with different views:

1. **Summary Tab**
   - Move information (name, type, power, category, accuracy, PP, priority)
   - Move effects list
   - Type effectiveness
   - Damage statistics (average, min, max, median)
   - Critical hit rates
   - Miss rates
   - Status effect statistics
   - Action generation statistics
   - Formatted text output

2. **Damage Tab**
   - DataGridView table showing:
     - Metric name
     - Value
     - Includes: total hits, average, min, max, median, critical hits, misses

3. **Status Effects Tab**
   - DataGridView table showing:
     - Type (Persistent/Volatile)
     - Effect name
     - Times caused
     - Percentage

4. **Actions Tab**
   - DataGridView table showing:
     - Action name
     - Times generated
     - Percentage

## Usage

### Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run --project PokemonUltimate.MoveDebuggerUI
```

Or from Rider/Visual Studio:
- Set `PokemonUltimate.MoveDebuggerUI` as startup project
- Press F5

### Configure and Run

1. Select move from dropdown
2. Select attacker Pokemon
3. Select target Pokemon
4. Set level (default: 50)
5. Set number of tests (default: 100)
6. Click "Run Tests"
7. Watch progress bar
8. View results in tabs

## Architecture

- **MainForm.cs** - Windows Forms UI with configuration and results display
- **MoveRunner.cs** - Reusable move testing logic extracted from console debugger
- Uses `UseMoveAction` to execute moves
- Tracks all `BattleAction` instances generated
- Collects statistics across multiple test runs

## Differences from Console MoveDebugger

| Feature | Console Debugger | UI Debugger |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Configuration | Edit code | Visual dropdowns |
| Output | Console text | Tables and formatted text |
| Progress | None | Progress bar |
| Results | Text summary | Multiple tabbed views |
| Execution | Synchronous | Async with UI updates |

## Notes

- Tests run asynchronously to keep UI responsive
- Progress updates during execution
- Results are displayed after all tests complete
- Uses same move testing logic as console debugger for consistency
- Shows move effects information at startup
- Tracks all actions generated by the move

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time results update during execution
- Export results to CSV/JSON
- Charts/graphs for damage distribution
- Save/load configurations
- Compare multiple moves side-by-side
