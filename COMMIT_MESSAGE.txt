refactor(Combat): Implement phase-based processor system for battle engine

Refactor the combat engine to use a phase-based processor architecture,
replacing the previous trigger-based system with specialized processors
for each battle phase/moment.

## Key Changes

### New Architecture
- **Phase-based processors**: Each battle phase has a dedicated processor
  implementing `IBattlePhaseProcessor`, `IActionGeneratingPhaseProcessor`,
  or `IStateModifyingPhaseProcessor`
- **TurnExecutor**: Orchestrates turn execution by coordinating phase processors
- **ActionProcessorObserver**: Observer pattern for reactive processors that
  respond to specific action types (DamageAction, SwitchAction, SetWeatherAction)
- **BattlePhase enum**: Defines all battle phases/moments where processors execute

### Processors Added
- Turn phases: `TurnStartProcessor`, `ActionCollectionProcessor`,
  `ActionSortingProcessor`, `FaintedPokemonSwitchingProcessor`,
  `EndOfTurnEffectsProcessor`, `TurnEndProcessor`, `DurationDecrementProcessor`
- Reactive phases: `SwitchInProcessor`, `BeforeMoveProcessor`,
  `AfterMoveProcessor`, `ContactReceivedProcessor`, `DamageTakenProcessor`,
  `WeatherChangeProcessor`
- Battle phases: `BattleStartProcessor`, `BattleEndProcessor`

### Removed Components
- `EndOfTurnProcessor` / `IEndOfTurnProcessor` (replaced by phase processors)
- `EntryHazardProcessor` / `IEntryHazardProcessor` (integrated into `SwitchInProcessor`)
- `BattleTriggerProcessor` / `IBattleTriggerProcessor` (replaced by phase processors)
- `BattleTrigger` enum (replaced by `BattlePhase`)
- `IBattleListener`, `AbilityListener`, `ItemListener` (replaced by phase processors)

### Refactored Components
- **CombatEngine**: Simplified constructor, now uses `TurnExecutor` internally
- **UseMoveAction**: Updated to use `BeforeMoveProcessor` and `AfterMoveProcessor`
- **Actions**: `DamageAction`, `SwitchAction`, `SetWeatherAction` now notify
  `ActionProcessorObserver` instead of directly calling processors

### File Organization
- Moved `BattleArbiter` and `BattleQueue` to `Engine/Battle/` subdirectory
- Created `Engine/Processors/` directory with `Interfaces/` subdirectory
- All processors use namespace `PokemonUltimate.Combat.Processors.Phases`

### Event System
- `BattleEventBus` now used exclusively for statistics and logging
- Removed game logic dependencies from event system
- `EventBasedBattleLogger` subscribes to events for logging

## Benefits
- ✅ Better separation of concerns: Each processor handles one phase
- ✅ Improved testability: Processors can be tested independently
- ✅ Clearer code organization: Logic grouped by battle phase, not by type
- ✅ Easier to extend: Add new processors for new phases without modifying existing code
- ✅ Decoupled actions from processors: Actions don't need to know about processors

## Breaking Changes
- `CombatEngine` constructor signature changed (simplified)
- `UseMoveAction` constructor signature changed (uses `BeforeMoveProcessor`/`AfterMoveProcessor`)
- Removed `EndOfTurnProcessor`, `EntryHazardProcessor`, `BattleTriggerProcessor` from public API

## Migration Notes
- `TurnOrderRunner.cs`: Updated to use new `UseMoveAction` constructor
- `InteractiveBattleSimulatorForm.cs`: Updated to use new `CombatEngine` constructor
- All tests updated to reflect new architecture

## Documentation
- Updated `docs/features/2-combat-system/code_location.md`
- Updated `docs/features/2-combat-system/2.6-combat-engine/README.md`
