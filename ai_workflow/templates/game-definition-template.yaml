## Usage

1. **Copy this template** to `docs/GAME_DEFINITION.yaml`
2. **Fill in game basics** (name, type, description, etc.)
3. **Define core concepts** (entities, environment, interactions, systems)
4. **Run feature generation** using `game-definition.yaml` decision tree
5. **Review and refine** generated features
