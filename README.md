## 🔄 The AI Development Workflow

The core innovation of this project is a **comprehensive, structured AI-assisted development workflow** that ensures quality, consistency, and maintainability across thousands of lines of code.

### 9-Step Mandatory Development Process

Every feature follows this exact workflow:

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Read Context & Specs** | Read `.ai/context.md`, architecture specs, complete incomplete specs |
| 2 | **Verify Spec Completeness** | Ensure all details documented (interfaces, classes, methods, examples) |
| 3 | **TDD: Write Functional Tests** | Create `[Feature]Tests.cs` with all main scenarios (red phase) |
| 4 | **Implement Feature** | Follow spec exactly, use existing patterns, make tests pass (green) |
| 5 | **Write Edge Case Tests** | Create `[Feature]EdgeCasesTests.cs` for boundaries, nulls, real-world |
| 6 | **Write Integration Tests** | Mandatory for system interactions (see integration guide) |
| 7 | **Validate Use Cases** | Check `docs/combat_use_cases.md` for combat features |
| 8 | **Verify Implementation** | Build (0 warnings), test (all pass), check checklists |
| 9 | **Update Documentation** | Update `.ai/context.md`, architecture docs, use cases |

### Problem-Solving Process

When issues arise during development:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Spec Incomplete** | Complete spec first, then implement |
| **Spec Incorrect** | Document discrepancy, fix spec or implementation |
| **Test Reveals Missing Feature** | Implement immediately (Test-Driven Discovery) |
| **Architectural Change Needed** | Document discovery, evaluate impact, update docs |

### Refactoring Process

Safe code improvement follows this pattern:

1. **Identify Scope** - What needs improvement? Check `docs/ai/anti-patterns.md`
2. **Verify Tests Exist** - If not, write tests first using TDD
3. **Refactor Safely** - Small incremental changes, run tests after each
4. **Maintain API Compatibility** - Or document breaking changes
5. **Update Documentation** - Architecture docs if pattern changed

## 🔄 How to Use This Methodology

Want to apply this AI workflow to your own project?

### 1. Set Up Rules

Create `.cursorrules` with your coding standards:

```markdown
# Project Rules

## Automatic Context Loading
ALWAYS read these files at the start of any task:
1. `.ai/context.md` - Current project state
2. `docs/ai/guidelines/project_guidelines.md` - Coding rules

## Development Workflow
When implementing a feature:
1. Read context and specs
2. Verify spec completeness
3. Write tests first (TDD)
4. Implement feature
5. Write edge case tests
6. Write integration tests
7. Validate against use cases
8. Verify implementation
9. Update documentation
```

### 2. Create Context File

Maintain `.ai/context.md` with project state:

```markdown
# AI Context Summary

## Current Project State
| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Current Phase** | Phase X |
| **Tests** | N passing |
| **Warnings** | 0 |

## Completed Systems
- [x] Feature A
- [x] Feature B
- [ ] Feature C (in progress)

## Key Architectural Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Pattern X | Reason Y |
```

### 3. Document Architecture

Write specs before implementation in `docs/features/[feature-name]/architecture.md` or `docs/shared/architecture/`:

```markdown
# Feature Specification

## Overview
What this feature does.

## API
- `ClassName.MethodName()` - Description

## Examples
```csharp
// Usage example
```

## Test Cases
1. Test scenario A
2. Test scenario B
```

### 4. Enforce TDD

Require tests before code in your rules:

```markdown
## TDD Mandate
- Write functional tests FIRST
- Write edge case tests after implementation
- Write integration tests for system interactions
- If test reveals missing functionality → implement it
```

### 5. Use Checklists

Create verification checklists:

**Pre-Implementation:**
- [ ] Read architecture spec
- [ ] Understand requirements
- [ ] Identify test cases

**Feature Complete:**
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] 0 warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Use cases validated

### 6. Provide Examples

Show the AI what good code looks like in `docs/ai/examples/`:

```markdown
# Good Code Examples

## Correct Pattern
```csharp
// This is the right way
```

## Anti-Pattern
```csharp
// Don't do this
```
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Core Philosophy

1. **Testability First** - All logic testable without Unity
2. **Action Queue Pattern** - Complex systems use action queues
3. **Input Symmetry** - Logic doesn't know Human vs AI
4. **Composition over Inheritance** - Moves use effects, not subclasses
5. **Registry Pattern** - No direct file loading in logic
6. **Slot System** - Supports 1v1, 2v2, 1v3, Horde modes
7. **Pipeline Pattern** - Complex math uses modular steps
8. **Event-Driven Extensions** - Abilities/Items use listeners

### Code Quality Standards

- ✅ **No Magic Strings** - Centralized constants (`ErrorMessages`, `GameMessages`)
- ✅ **No Magic Numbers** - Named constants only
- ✅ **Fail-Fast** - Exceptions for invalid inputs
- ✅ **Guard Clauses** - Early validation
- ✅ **TDD Mandatory** - Tests before implementation
- ✅ **XML Documentation** - All public APIs documented

---

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Type Effectiveness
- Gen 6+ chart (Fairy type included)
- STAB = 1.5x multiplier
- Dual-type multipliers combine

### Stat Calculation
- Gen 3+ formulas
- HP formula differs from other stats
- Nature modifiers (0.9x, 1.0x, 1.1x)
- IVs (0-31) and EVs (0-252 per stat)

### Battle Mechanics
- Turn order: Priority → Speed → Random
- Damage pipeline: Base → Crit → Random → STAB → Type → Status
- Status effects: Burn, Poison, Toxic, Sleep, Freeze, Paralysis
- Stat stages: -6 to +6 with proper multipliers
- End-of-turn effects: Status damage processing

---

## 🧪 Testing

The project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with three-phase testing:

1. **Functional Tests** - Core behavior verification
2. **Edge Case Tests** - Boundary conditions and real-world scenarios
3. **Integration Tests** - System interactions and cascading effects

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
dotnet test

# Specific test category
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~IntegrationTests"

# Single test file
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CombatEngineTests"
```
