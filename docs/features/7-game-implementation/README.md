# Feature 7: Game Implementation

> Text-based demo game implementation to test all game features before Unity integration.

**Feature Number**: 7  
**See**: [`../../features_master_list.md`](../../features_master_list.md) for feature numbering standards.

## Overview

This feature implements a complete text-based demo game that tests all game features before Unity integration. The demo provides a simple, text-heavy interface to validate game systems, mechanics, and features in a playable format.

**Status**: ⏳ Planned

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Text-based interface** - Simple visual design, primarily text-based
- **Complete game loop** - Full gameplay experience from start to finish
- **Feature validation** - Tests all features from Features 1-5
- **Pre-Unity testing** - Validates game systems before Unity integration

## Quick Links

- **Phases Planned**: 7.1-7.6 (Game implementation phases)
- **Key Classes**: See [code location](code_location.md) for planned structure
- **Tests**: See [testing](testing.md) for test strategy
