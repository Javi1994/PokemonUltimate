  # Basic Information
  basics:
    name: "Pokemon Ultimate"
    type: "Turn-Based Strategy / Battle Simulator"
    description: |
      A complete Pokémon battle engine built as an SDK for Unity integration.
      The engine provides all game logic (combat system, damage calculation, turn order,
      status effects, abilities, items) while Unity handles presentation (UI, animations, audio).
      The core logic is completely testable without Unity, making it perfect for both
      game development and battle simulation. Built with clean architecture principles
      and comprehensive test coverage (2,075+ tests).
    target_platform: "Unity"
    sdk_purpose: "Logic layer for Unity integration - provides game logic, Unity handles presentation"
